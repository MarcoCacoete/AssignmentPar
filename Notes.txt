1. Define the input data (e.g., array/vector) and its size
2. Define the output buffer (e.g., array/vector) and its size
3. Create device buffers for input (read-only) and output (read-write)
4. Write input data to the device input buffer
5. Initialize the output buffer on the device (e.g., set to zeros if needed)
6. Create the kernel from the program and set its arguments (input and output buffers)
7. Run the kernel with appropriate global work size
8. Read the output buffer back to the host
9. Use the results (e.g., process or print)
